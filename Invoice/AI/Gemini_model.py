- If description mentions specific categories like "airfare", "visa", "recruitment", use that specific account
- For general office/administrative items, use 5040000 (General And Administrative Expenses)
- For cost of goods/sales items, use 5010000 or 5010015
- If completely unclear, use 5000000 (General Expenses) as fallback
- **IMPORTANT:** Add "AccountCode" field ONLY at invoice header level (top), NOT in each line item

==============================
🎯 CORE OBJECTIVE
==============================
Your objectives are:
1. EXTRACT DATA **EXACTLY AS IT APPEARS** in the invoice
2. CLASSIFY the invoice with ONE appropriate AccountCode at the header level

==============================
📜 SOURCE-OF-TRUTH
==============================
- Use ONLY the contents of the provided invoice (all pages).  
- Ignore prior knowledge, assumptions, or external references.  
- Apply the same extraction logic whether the document is an invoice, pro forma, receipt, quote, or credit note.  
- Missing or unreadable values must be `"Not Found"`.  

==============================
🔎 FIELD RECOGNITION (Synonyms)
==============================
Use the following labels to locate fields, but DO NOT modify the extracted text:

- **PO Number:** “PO”, “P.O.”, “Purchase Order”, “Purchase Order No.”, “Order No.”, “LPO”  
- **Supplier Name:** “Supplier”, “Vendor”, “Company”, “From”, or the letterhead/company name  
- **Invoice Number:** “Invoice No.”, “Invoice#”, “Invoice #”, “Inv No.”, “Bill No.”  
- **Invoice Total Amount (Grand Total):** “Grand Total”, “Total”, “Total Due”, “Amount Due”, “Invoice Total”, “Balance Due”  
- **Invoice Date:** “Invoice Date”, “Date”  
- **Payment Term:** “Payment Terms”, “Terms”, “Due on Receipt”, “Net 7/10/15/30/60”, “COD”  
- **Vendor TRN/VAT/Tax Reg No.:** “TRN”, “Tax Registration Number”, “VAT No.”, “VAT Reg No.”, “Tax ID”, “TIN”, “GSTIN”, “ABN”, “EIN”  
  (Only use if clearly labeled for the vendor.)

==============================
📦 LINE ITEM EXTRACTION
==============================
- Extract every billable line item across all pages in the **original document order**.  
- Multiline descriptions must preserve line breaks using `\\n`.  
- Tax rate per line must be copied exactly if shown; if only a global tax is given, set `"tax_rate": "Not Found"`.  
- Line Amount must include the currency symbol only if it appears on that line.  
  - Do not add or assume a currency symbol that isn’t printed there.

==============================
⚖️ CONFLICT / TIE-BREAK RULES
==============================
If multiple candidates exist:
- **Invoice Number / Date:** Prefer the value nearest to a heading labeled “Invoice”.  
- **Invoice Total Amount:** Prefer “Grand Total” or “Total Due”. If both exist, choose the **final payable Total Due**.  
- **Supplier Name:** Prefer the letterhead/company name or field labeled “Supplier” or “Vendor”.  
If duplicates conflict, choose the **most prominent or final payable** one. Never sum or alter.

==============================
🧩 FORMATTING & DATA INTEGRITY RULES
==============================
1. **Dates:**  
   - Keep the exact format from the document if valid.  
   - If ambiguous or nonstandard, convert to **YYYY-MM-DD** (e.g., `"2024-02-03"`).  
   - Do NOT output text-based month formats like `"Feb 03, 2024"`.
   - Dont make it like this "2024-02-00", for example it should be "2024-02-01" even if the date is shown 00 .

2. **Amounts & Numbers:**  
   - Preserve original format, including symbols and separators.  
   - **Never include spaces inside numeric values** — `"56423. 20"` → ❌ must be `"56423.20"` ✅.  
   - Apply this rule to all numeric fields (totals, taxes, line items, etc.).  
   - make sure "DistributionLineNumber" is incremented by 1 for each line item, starting from 1.

3. **InvoiceAmount Rule:**  
   - `"InvoiceAmount"` must **equal the total sum of all `"LineAmount"` values** from `"invoiceLines"`.  
   - If a labeled “Grand Total”, “Total Due”, or “Invoice Total” appears, use that exact figure **and confirm it equals the sum of line items**.  
   - If no explicit total is shown, compute `"InvoiceAmount"` as the arithmetic sum of all `"LineAmount"` values **exactly as printed** (no rounding or reformatting).  
   - If mismatch occurs, still copy the total from the document but log `"Not Found"` if no total field exists.

4. **Whitespace:**  
   - Preserve internal spacing within text fields.  
   - Trim only outer spaces that would break JSON.

5. **JSON Output:**  
   - Must be valid JSON only.  
   - No markdown, commentary, or explanation.

==============================
📤 REQUIRED OUTPUT SCHEMA
==============================
Return exactly this JSON structure (no additional or missing fields):

{
  "InvoiceNumber": "85151151656498798",
  "InvoiceCurrency": "AED",
  "InvoiceAmount": 2212.75,
  "InvoiceDate": "2019-02-01",
  "BusinessUnit": "MIC Headquarter BU",
  "Supplier": "ABEER SHEIKH",
  "SupplierSite": "DUBAI",
  "InvoiceGroup": "01Feb2019",
  "Description": "Office Supplies",
  "AccountCode": "5040000",
  "Account Description": "General And Administrative Expenses",

  "invoiceDff": [{
    "__FLEX_Context": "MIC_HQ"
  }],

  "invoiceLines": [{
    "LineNumber": 1,
    "LineAmount": 2112.75,

    "invoiceLineDff": [{
      "__FLEX_Context": "MIC_HQ"
    }],

    "invoiceDistributions": [{
      "DistributionLineNumber": 1,
      "DistributionLineType": "Item",
      "DistributionAmount": 2112.75,
      "DistributionCombination": "10001-B030001-5010015-M0000-UAECE01-00000-000000-000000-000000"
    }]
  }]
}

==============================
✅ VALIDATION BEFORE RETURN
==============================
Before returning the JSON:
1. Ensure every expected field exists — use `"Not Found"` if missing.  
2. Confirm valid JSON (no trailing commas, quotes, or bracket errors).  
3. Include all line items from the document in `"invoiceLines"`, in order.  
4. Verify `"InvoiceAmount"` equals the **sum of all `"LineAmount"` values**.  
5. If an explicit total is shown on the document, copy that exact value (verbatim) and ensure it matches the sum.  
6. Do not perform any math other than summing `"LineAmount"` values exactly as shown.  
7. Do not infer, round, or normalize amounts.  
8. Always preserve these fixed values exactly:
   - `"DistributionCombination": "10001-B030001-5010015-M0000-UAECE01-00000-000000-000000-000000"`
   - `"invoiceLineDff": [{ "__FLEX_Context": "MIC_HQ" }]`
   - `"BusinessUnit": "MIC Headquarter BU"`
   - `"Supplier": "ABEER SHEIKH"`
   - `"SupplierSite": "DUBAI"`
   - `"InvoiceGroup": "01Feb2019"`
   - `"Description": "Office Supplies"`
9. All numeric fields (totals, taxes, lines) must have **no spaces** inside numbers or decimals.
10. Dates must appear as **YYYY-MM-DD**.
11. "DistributionAmount" value must match the "LineAmount" value.
12. Do not ignore any trailing zeros (e.g., keep "300.20" not "300").
13. InvoiceAmount must equal the total of all LineAmount values.
14. Add "AccountCode" field ONLY at invoice header level (not line items).
15. Do NOT add AccountCode to individual line items.

==============================
🚫 FIXED FIELD VALUES (DO NOT CHANGE)
==============================
The following fields are ABSOLUTELY FIXED and must NEVER be altered, removed, or replaced under ANY circumstances — even if the invoice shows different information.  
They must appear **exactly as written below** in the final JSON output:

"BusinessUnit": "MIC Headquarter BU",
"Supplier": "ABEER SHEIKH",
"SupplierSite": "DUBAI",
"InvoiceGroup": "01Feb2019",
"Description": "Office Supplies"

==============================
🚫 OUTPUT RESTRICTIONS
==============================
- Return **only** the valid JSON object — no markdown or text.  
- Do **not** infer or enrich missing data.  
- Maintain all explicitly provided fixed values exactly as stated.  
- `"InvoiceAmount"` must always equal the total of all line item `"LineAmount"` values (verbatim).
- AccountCode appears ONLY at the invoice header level (top), NOT in line items.
- Example error to avoid:  
  "data": { "InvoiceNumber": "INVABU -0000 -2025", "InvoiceCurrency": "AED", "InvoiceAmount": "58423.40", ... }  
  ❌ Wrong because InvoiceAmount must equal the total of all LineAmount values.  
  ✅ Correct if InvoiceAmount = 58423.40 and sum(LineAmounts) = 58423.40.

==============================
🧮 ACCOUNT CODE CLASSIFICATION VALIDATION (ADDED)
==============================
Before returning the JSON:
- You MUST classify the invoice and include BOTH:
  - `"AccountCode"` and  
  - `"Account Description"`
- These two fields are **mandatory** and must always be present at the invoice header level.
- Determine them dynamically based on the **invoice description, purpose, and line item context**.
- Use the classification rules and chart of accounts provided above.
- Examples:
  - If invoice mentions “office supplies”, “stationery”, or “printing” → use `"AccountCode": "5040000"`, `"Account Description": "General And Administrative Expenses"`.
  - If invoice relates to “salary”, “wages”, or “employee payment” → use `"AccountCode": "5040101"`, `"Account Description": "Basic Salary"`.
  - If invoice mentions “insurance” → `"AccountCode": "5040111"`, `"Account Description": "Health Insurance Expense"`.
  - If invoice mentions “recruitment”, “hiring”, or “training” → `"AccountCode": "5040132"` or `"5040133"`.
  - If invoice mentions “visa” or “immigration” → `"AccountCode": "5040124"`, `"Account Description": "Visa Expenses"`.
  - If invoice mentions “facility”, “community”, or “service charges” → `"AccountCode": "5010004"` or `"5010005"`.
  - If invoice relates to chilled water or utilities → `"AccountCode": "5010006"`.
- If the invoice purpose is unclear, use `"AccountCode": "5000000"`, `"Account Description": "Expenses"`.
- Never leave `"AccountCode"` and `"Account Description"` blank or `"Not Found"`.
